# FlashThing

FlashThing is a tool for quickly and easily flashing the Spotify Car Thing (Superbird). FlashThing is composed of four parts:

- **FlashThing**: Rust crate for flashing superbird.
- **FlashThing CLI**: Command line interface for FlashThing.
- **FlashThing Node**: N-API bindings for FlashThing.
- **FlashThing Wasm**: WebUSB bindings for FlashThing, for flashing from a browser.

FlashThing currently supports flashing the Stock partition tables as well as custom partition tables using a subset of the Terbium `meta.json` standard. Read more about that standard in the [docs](./docs/meta.md).

FlashThing can flash over two protocols: amlogic's vendor burn mode (the default, and what a stock device offers) or standard Android fastboot against mainline u-boot. Both take the same `meta.json` — see the [fastboot docs](./docs/fastboot.md).

## Installation

### Rust Crate

```bash
cargo add flashthing
```

### CLI

```bash
cargo install flashthing-cli
```

### Node Module Installation

```bash
npm install flashthing
yarn add flashthing
pnpm add flashthing
bun add flashthing
```

### Platform Specific Notes

#### Linux

FlashThing requires `libusb` to be installed, and a udev rule must be set up to access the Car Thing. To install the udev rule, run the following command:

```bash
sudo flashthing-cli --udev
```

#### macOS

FlashThing requires `libusb` to be installed. You can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install libusb
```

#### Windows

FlashThing may require special drivers (I don't have a Windows machine to test on). If you have issues, try running the [Terbium driver script](https://driver.terbium.app/get).

```powershell
irm https://driver.terbium.app/get | iex
```

## Usage

### Rust Crate Usage

See [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/flashthing/latest/flashthing/) and the [cli](./cli) for more information.

Note: The documentation is very basic, sorry!

### CLI Usage

```bash
❯ flashthing-cli --help
cli for flashing the Spotify Car Thing

Usage: flashthing-cli [OPTIONS] [PATH]

Arguments:
  [PATH]  Path to a zip file or a directory. Defaults to the current working directory if omitted

Options:
  -s, --stock          Whether the directory or archive contains a stock dump with no `meta.json` file
      --unbrick        Whether to unbrick the device
      --setup          setup host - this currently only sets up udev rules on Linux
      --bulkcmd <CMD>  Send a single u-boot command to a device in USB burn mode and print its response
  -f, --fastboot       Flash over fastboot against mainline u-boot instead of amlogic burn mode
      --console <CMD>  Run a single u-boot command over fastboot's `oem console` and print its output
      --sparse         Treat every raw write as sparse, skipping all-zero chunks. Only meaningful with --fastboot
  -h, --help           Print help
  -V, --version        Print version
```

To flash a device running mainline u-boot, add `--fastboot`. A device in USB mode (buttons 1 & 4 held at power-on) is
RAM-booted into mainline u-boot first; one already in fastboot is used as-is.

```bash
flashthing-cli --fastboot ./firmware.zip
```

### Node Module Usage

```typescript
import { FlashThing, type FlashEvent } from 'flashthing';

const callback = (event: FlashEvent) => {
  console.log('Flash event:', event);
};

// pass `{ fastboot: true }` as a second argument to flash over fastboot instead of amlogic burn mode
const flasher = new FlashThing(callback);
await flasher.openArchive('path/to/archive.zip');

console.log(`Total flashing steps: ${flasher.getNumSteps()}`);
await flasher.flash();
```

### Browser Usage

```bash
cd wasm && wasm-pack build --target web
```

The browser owns device permission and archive handling, so the page supplies them as callbacks. `awaitGesture`
resolves once the user has clicked — the chooser only opens while that click is still live, and it is called again
after a BL2 boot resets the SoC. `readAll` and `open` resolve payload paths out of the flash archive, with `open`
returning `{ size, read(n) }` for streaming.

```typescript
import init, { FlashThing } from './pkg/flashthing_wasm.js';

await init();

const flasher = new FlashThing((event) => console.log(event), {
  readAll,
  open,
  awaitGesture,
  fastboot: true, // omit for amlogic burn mode
});

await flasher.openJson(metaJson);
console.log(`Total flashing steps: ${flasher.getNumSteps()}`);
await flasher.flash();
```
